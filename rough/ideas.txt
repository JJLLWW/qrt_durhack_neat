can it just store the logs in a DB so all stats stuff is easy to do by default
(how to do regex search on a db?)

not sure how continuous analysis would work

- some kind of web frontend for visualising the data <- React, antd?
- how to analyse multiple in parallel? multiple tabs? not sure panes are easy to do in browser
- save and reload filters
- how can a web based page track real time logs as passing a file over a web gui just gives a snapshot

- maybe CLI based tool that exposes a browser interface (won't the browser stuff need to be quite
involved though?

running the tool should give commands to add files and stuff, not sure how you'd make path completion work.
- input loop with a load feature.

- if it stores into a db anyway (instead of a dataframe) what's the point of doing it in python? nodeJS, browserJS
- should it use redis or something for speed (too complicated)



- alerts implementation?
